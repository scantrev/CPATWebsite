# CPATWebsite
Here is the newer and simpler version

The login works with the StarterSite.sdf file workinng as the DB of users

The register page works now

The "Forgot Password" link works now and sends through an SMTP server of Gmail (Public use)

The CSS is set on Site.css mostly. 

The CSS for the header has had colors and images from the IWCC homepage.

All link buttons work but not all code is in place and what is can be edited at some point to be higher quality.

We need to add a Quiz Intro Page and I'll nearly done with the quizzes themselves but we can easily change the questions once we decide on the final questions.
